  <p>
    Hi, I'm Juan Carielo, back-end developer working with PHP at Everis.
  </p>

  <p>
    I work with Drupal, a Content Management System (CMS), I also use Acquia Cloud to manage and host websites, in addition to some DevOps work.
  </p>

  <p>
    My development stack is based on the amazing Manjaro Linux, along with Oh My Zsh, which helps me a lot on the terminal.
  </p>

  <p>
    I worked with some frameworks like Symfony, Laravel, CakePHP and CodeIgniter (the first one that helped me to understand the MVC structure) and also with MySQL, MongoDB and databases modeling.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also created small features to manipulate data, using NodeJS, performed some web scraping, with Selenium treating the content to JSON format and then performed a importation.
  </p>

  <p>
    I dedicate my spare time to studying and specializing in Python, with the aim of working with AI, as soon as possible.
  </p>
