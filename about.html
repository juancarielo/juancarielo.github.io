<div id="about" class="text-justify my-5">
  <p>Hey I'm Juan Carielo, Solutions Engineer working at Acquia.</p>
  <p>
    I worked with Drupal, a Content Management System (CMS), using Acquia Cloud
    to manage and host websites, in addition to some DevOps works.
  </p>
  <p>
    The beginning I studied MVC, then started to work with frameworks like
    CodeIgniter, CakePHP, Laravel and Symfony also databases modeling with MySQL
    and MongoDB.
  </p>
  <p>
    Handling to created small features to use data with NodeJS like CSV, for
    example a web scraping using Python and Selenium to treating a content to
    JSON format and then performed some importations, this was a challenge cool.
  </p>
  <p>
    Exercises to lead a healthy life and trying to read some books for self
    development.
  </p>
  <p>
    Regularly I'm studying about software engineering and learning other
    languages like JavaScript and Python to discover new things.
    But now, I'm focusing on learning more about business to improve myself in the area.
  </p>
  <p>Enjoy and thanks for the visit.</p>
