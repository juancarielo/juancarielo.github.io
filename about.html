  Hi, I'm Juan Carielo, back-end developer working with <a href="http://php.net/" target="_blank">PHP</a> at <a href="https://www.everis.com/brazil" target="_blank">everis</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Today I work with <a href="https://drupal.org/" target="_blank">Drupal</a>, a Content Management System (CMS), I also use
  <a href="https://www.acquia.com/" target="_blank">Acquia Cloud</a> to manage and host websites, in addition to some DevOps jobs.
</p>

<p>
  My development stack is based on the amazing <a href="https://manjaro.org/" target="_blank">Manjaro</a> Linux Distro along with
  <a href="https://ohmyz.sh/" target="_blank">Oh My Zsh</a> which helps me a lot in the terminal.
</p>

<p>
  I've worked with some frameworks like <a href="https://symfony.com/" target="_blank">Symfony</a>, <a href="https://laravel.com/" target="_blank">Laravel</a>,
  <a href="https://cakephp.org/" target="_blank">CakePHP</a> and <a href="https://codeigniter.com/" target="_blank">CodeIgniter</a> (the first that helped me understand the MVC structure).
  I can't forget about the databases like <a href="https://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank">MySQL</a>, <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a> and database modeling.
</p>

<p>
  I even made small features to manipulate data using <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">NodeJS</a>, to do some web scraping using
  <a href="https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank">Selenium</a> and export data to JSON format.
</p>

<p>
  In my spare time I'm studying <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a> so that I can specialize and create maturity to be able to work with AI in the near future.
