Development and maintenance using architecture _coupled_ and _multilingual_ with Drupal 9 at Acquia.

The project was intended to bring programs, training, manuals for the health area.

Technologies as SonarQube to check the quality of the project and Solr to index the content.

With a lot of custom modules, multilingual configurations, integrations, etc.

Here I had my first opportunity using English working remotely.
